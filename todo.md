# Todos and other improvements

## Improvements
* TESTS!
* Horizontal layout
* More JSDoc

## Things I don't like and would like to fix
* The `transition` method and the options object that it receives.
* Move everything to Shuffle.prototype.method = function.
* `_layout` and `_placeItem`s parameters.
* Less jQuery dependency

## Reason Zepto doesn't work
* `.data()` - although I think it can be included?
* `.filter()` and `.not()` don't work with collections.
* `.css(['style1', 'style2', 'style3'])` isn't supported.
