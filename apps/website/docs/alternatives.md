# Alternatives

Shuffle won't fit every use case. There are also features I am not interested in implementing because of the level of effort it would take to write or they exist in other libraries.

Shuffle likely will not grow much farther than the current feature set. If you need something with drag and drop, filling in gaps, more layout modes, etc., I suggest looking into [packery](http://packery.metafizzy.co/) or [isotope](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/).
